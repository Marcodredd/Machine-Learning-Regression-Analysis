# Machine-Learning-Regression-Analysis
## Regression Algorithms using the housing dataset
After taken the course Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize [2024] on Udemy by Kirill Eremenko, Hadelin de Ponteves and others, this repository is to document the knowledge gained by predicting the median house price using the housing dataset.

The following machine learning regression algorithms will be tested:
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression

## The R2 Score Verdict
The R2 score for the various machine learning models for regression in order of performance:
Random Forrest Regressor - 81%
Polynomial Regressor - 63%
Multiple Linear Regressor - 62%
Decision Tree Regressor - 62.5%
Support Vector Regressor - 32%

The adjustment of each models hyperparameters may improve the model's performance.
You are free to explore using the models as given.
Suggestions on how to further improve the model is welcome
